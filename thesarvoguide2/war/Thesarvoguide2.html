//var guide_xml='<guide guidestars="**" pagesize="1000" version="3">\n<header access="Turn left onto Safety Cove Road, just past the turn off to Port Arthur (about 200m past the petrol station / store).&#10; Drive to the very end of this road and park at the Remarkable Cave car park. A signpost marks the start of a formed track leading towards Mt Brown, and most cliffs in the area are accessed by leaving this track at the appropriate time. Access to Parrot Shelf: turn off to the right at a small sandy creek (after about 30 minutes). The top of the Parrot Shelf cliff is a short walk from here, and the base accessed at the southern end. Access to Paradiso: walk to the top of the Parrot Shelf, then continue south along the shore slabs for another 5 minutes. A short downclimb is required to reach the base of the cliffs, or otherwise abseil in Access to Dauntless Point: follow the track past the sandy creek until it starts to head left. Head a little to the right of the saddle between Mt. Brown and Dauntless Point toward a black dead patch (now regrown with plenty of thick scrub) near the base of the hill. From here, head up to the saddle where upon easy walking with an excellent outlook may be had up along the eastern edge of the cliffs to the highest point. The cliff edge may be followed the whole way to the end of the point, with a rough track providing access through scrubby sections (about 15 more minutes). It is also possible (and less scrubby) to branch off the main Mount Brown track when it starts to steepen (just after the triangular fork) and follow the contour around to the Dauntless/Brown col. Alternatively from the top of the Paradiso follow the occasional cairn up and right across the top of the Paradiso before ascending more directly to gain the top just north of the Dauntless abseil. Access to Mount Brown Main Face: follow the main walking track to a triangular fork below the slopes of Mount Brown and then take the summit track heading uphill. When about 50m from the trig station, turn west and head towards the highest point at the cliff edge (about 1 hour from the car to the rap station). The main walking track continues all the way to Crescent Bay, which is a worthwhile diversion (especially on a hot day), as well as having some additional climbing at each end." acknowledgement="by Marcel Jackson and Roger Parkyn, originally published in Craglets." history="" intro="The cliffs around Mt. Brown provide a substantial range of climbing in an exciting setting. Like half of Tassie\'s southern coastline, the rock is dolerite, but despite its location directly between Cape Raoul and Cape Pillar, there is not a column to be seen. Huge weathered sheets of featured rock form towering overhanging walls on the west side, while to the east the same formations make even larger slabs.  The steep walls have a heap of potential for some really fantastic cranking, and have already yielded a healthy harvest of classic sport climbs.  Climbs of most grades, styles and angles exist in relative abundance, but arguably the best aspect about this area is the atmosphere. There are few experiences as pleasant as sitting on the warm rocks at Land\'s End in the late afternoon sun watching the Gannets dive. Even the evil 170m cave cliff of Mt. Brown glows orange and succumbs to the magic. On the other hand, there are few experiences as dramatic and ferocious as the Paradiso when the sea gets up." name="Mount Brown" rock="Wave sculpted dolerite, 10-200m" sun="Afternoon sun" walk="20-60 minutes" id="1"/>\n\n\n<gps id="2"><point code="MBR010" description="DNA Land; Top of Stem Cell" easting="569331" height="32" northing="5216888" zone="55G"/><point code="MBR020" description="Parrot Shelf; Top of Geronimo" easting="569835" height="22" northing="5216469" zone="55G"/><point code="MBR030" description="40 Degrees South; Slab where you turn off to go to anchors" easting="569994" height="0" northing="5216028" zone="55G"/><point code="MBR040" description="40 Degrees South; Rap anchors" easting="569966" height="0" northing="5215989" zone="55G"/><point code="MBR050" description="Time Goes Bye; Rap anchors" easting="570343" height="168" northing="5215926" zone="55G"/><point code="MBR051" description="I\'ve Heard it all Before; Rap anchors" easting="570358" height="170" northing="5215911" zone="55G"/><point code="MBR301" description="No Contest (Hidden Face); Rap Anchors" easting="570826" northing="5215818" height="150"/></gps><image noPrint="false" src="mountBrownMap.png" width="800" id="3"/>\n\n<text class="heading3" id="4">DNA Land</text><text class="Discussion" id="5">This small area has some good climbs similar to the Cataract Gorge and is largely unaffected by swell.

Move L along the horizontal break to the intermittent crack line. Up this and the face above for 20m to another horizontal break. Move L to the arête and climb up it to the shallow corner.

Start at the very end of the main ledge below Step Tier. (The slab below this has been climbed as an alternative start). &lt;br/&gt;1a. 30m. Ascend 2m then traverse R on dodgy rock to the prominent crack line. Follow this, past the cave, to the 'step' of the Tier. &lt;br/&gt;1b. 30m. (17) Alternatively (better but a tad harder), climb directly up from the start for about 10m and then hand traverse R on the horizontal break to the cave, continuing up the original route. &lt;br/&gt;2a. 42m. Climb the crack line on the south side of the prow past the old dodgy peg (still there in 2007), continuing up the walls and chimney above to finish up the arête. &lt;br/&gt;2b. 25m. (17) Face Climbers Variant. Climb the arête R of the cracks until it merges with the original line. Finish as for 2a. &lt;br/&gt;3. 5m.

Climb the crack to the R side of the Moonraker 'hole', continue straight up the face and climb the black water-streaked wall with the thin cracks above. The gear is adequate but well spaced. Belay on the step as for Moonraker.

Up a short corner and face above (mind the suspect rock) to a ledge below a wide crack. Up the crack (crux) to a belay ledge (less sweat with a #4 Camalot). &lt;br/&gt;3. 26m.

Up a short groove, negotiate the suspect wall, then up twin cracks to LH end of terrace. Climb the groove, then over a bulge to an alcove below the overhung corner. &lt;br/&gt;2. 26m 19. Bridge, hipsmear and fingerjam the steep corner to a large ledge (crux). &lt;br/&gt;3. 26m 18. Switch R to the natural continuation of the Ophthalmia line. Follow the crack round two roofs to the top.

Direct start: Phil Steane, Pete Steane, Oct 1982.\">So named after the large quantities of loose dirt which once remained after the devastating 1967 bushfires. Pitch two is steep and sustained, and harder now the dead tree has departed. The route takes the RH of two crack lines in the middle of the tier that are 4m apart. &lt;br/&gt;1. 24m 16. Climb the first pitch of Lone Stranger as far as the terrace. Traverse R 4m and belay at the foot of the prominent crack. A direct start climbs the blocky orange face directly below pitch two. &lt;br/&gt;2. 36m 18. Follow the line up into a chimney and a small bush (50-50 friend &amp; foe). Navigate past the bush and up the delightful crack above to large belay ledge. &lt;br/&gt;3. 21m 16. Switch to the LH crack, which has two awkward moves, one past a tea tree and one almost at the top.</climb> &#10;  <climb extra=\"↓\" grade=\"16\" length=\"80m\" name=\"Peacepipe\" number=\"6.\" stars=\"*\" id=\"4\" fa=\"J.

Climb the scrub-free zone 1m L of the corner until encouraged back R into the line. Continue to the scrubby terrace then up the vee-groove to a ledge on the RHS. Alternatively climb the first pitch of Lone Stranger as far as the terrace and traverse R across it to join the line below the vee-groove.&lt;br/&gt;2. 45m. Climb the crack through the bulge to a ledge (crux). Continue up the interesting and sustained steep crack and chimney to the top.

Up this for 6m. &lt;br/&gt;3. 10m Move R on scrubby terrace into a deep vee-groove. &lt;br/&gt;4. 25m Chimney up the vee-groove (Peace Pipe), then move R up the nasty steep grassy slope and belay above the vegetation. &lt;br/&gt;5. 10m Up the corner crack on the L to belay on a large shelf at foot of the irregular chimney. &lt;br/&gt;6. 30m Follow the chimney over a bulge and into a deep recess. Continue up the wider chimney above and belay on a scrubby flat on top of the main buttress. &lt;br/&gt;7. 22m Up a line of weakness to finish on a ridge leading to the top.</climb> &#10;</guide>";
