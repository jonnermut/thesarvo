======= Bugs ========

GPS
- adding a new GPS block sucks badly
- Adding new stuff onto map doesnt set the pid properly so they dont show up


Misc
- 'extra page' stuff on image legend not working. Maybe get rid of this
- sometimes get edits by 'anonymous' users
- editing a stale page can overwrite newer edits - need to check versions etc

======= Phototopo =========

- link to for text boxes - link to other pages/topos
- arrow heads by default for bouldering 
- dbl click point broken?
- redraw lower off to match Jeds version
- attachment list lists all versions??
- adding text doesnt add at the cursor, and often adds 2 text boxes
- adding line often adds 2 points at the start
- text boxes lose their line breaks

======= Maps =========


- labels & links for drawing objects
- default view port for when no markers
- Single 'crag' co-ordinate for large scale maps
- Aggregated map on contents pages

======= Features ========

- Comment on climbs
-- Use confluence's comments, and hack them so that a thread is created per climb, and is move by GWT to the climb

- arrow heads
- autonumbering
- Northern buttress - graph says 76 routes, is actually 53!!

======= Deano's ========


### In progress

An "over-the-back" abseil symbol
For abseils that go out of view

needs some svg ninja work...


### Done

Topo line styles
  Dotted and dashed lines, for access paths and "out of view" climbs
  NOTE: bug in Raphael for dots?

Hover to highlight
  lines are highlighted when hovering over the corresponding row in the legend
  (along with the row itself also being highlighted)
  popup description appears when row is clicked


### Bugs

Line breaks in text area
These appear in edit mode, but not when viewed the guide page.
The text area background seems to expand though
see access topo at
http://www.thesarvo.com/confluence/display/thesarvo/Cape+Raoul

Can't delete text areas
(Jed said you might have fixed this already?)

Text wrapping in popups
Take a look at the SSSSI topo at
http://thesarvo.com/confluence/display/thesarvo/Bulging+Buttress

With route #1, the route description goes outside the border of the popup box
(after clicking on the line). I'm not sure why, it doesn't seem to be because
it is a multi-pitch route (with the special formatting) because similar routes
on other pages work fine... a bit weird.



### Feature Ideas

An option to hide the topo lines
Sometimes the thick lines hide the detail on the route when trying to figure out where to go.


Anchor point for route description popup (when clicking on legend)
When clicking on row in legend, the popup always appears below the legend, and
left-aligned to the bottom left corner. On some topos, e.g. the Paradiso Left
Side topo, it would be neat to specify where the popup appears, and which edge
is fixed (if applicable). For example, for that topo the top-left corner of the
popup could be anchored to the top-right corner of the legend, so it doesnt
cover the routes as much. For other topos, in might be useful to have the
top-right corner of the popup fixed to the bottom-right corner of the legend
(or anywhere else, etc.)

### Enhancements

Take a look at SSSSI topo again
http://thesarvo.com/confluence/display/thesarvo/Bulging+Buttress

Diverging/common topo lines
If selecting a route that branches off one of the others, it would be good if
the entire line was highlighted. For example, when selecting #2, the bottom
section off the ground isn't highlighted because it is associated with #3 only.

Better display of merging of lines
Often when the lines merge, they stick out a bit and look untidy. You probably
already know this (and have probably spent a considerable amount of time
tweaking and making it pretty good already!). Another example is Paradiso Left
Side topo merging Kraken into Offender, this was the best i could do. Another
example is the join of routes #3 and #4 on the SSSSI topo.

Currently you have to drag the 'floating' end point on top of the existing
point manually. If there was a way to 'snap' the point on top, or (perhaps
better) link into the existing point that could make it easier to draw tidier
curved lines? It may also make it simpler to associate common line segments
with multiple routes (for the Diverging/common topo lines item above)?
